Testing application

(2) group work
Same completionist idea across multiple people? A group of people can log a single habit. Or maybe its more of just combining habits together ? If they both can work on the same habit, they can each have their own goals, and only when they complete it together does it count. 
how should the friends section look? 

The creation of a group habit. It takes the whole group to complete a day with each person creating their own part. I'm not sure how well this will work in practice, and people can easily just cheat and not do it. Accountability is good, but its hard to enforce real action.
