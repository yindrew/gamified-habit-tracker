(2) group work
Same completionist idea across multiple people? A group of people can log a single habit. Or maybe its more of just combining habits together ? If they both can work on the same habit, they can each have their own goals, and only when they complete it together does it count. 
how should the friends section look? 

The creation of a group habit. It takes the whole group to complete a day with each person creating their own part. I'm not sure how well this will work in practice, and people can easily just cheat and not do it. Accountability is good, but its hard to enforce real action. 



make the components slideable? It feels very intuitive to slide the components in the home screen. Slide right, edit and delete. Slide left, Coping plan if avaliable, skip if avaliable

pressing and holding the entire bar starts the circle.

timer should be displayed as a long notification as well. 

Pressing return during the routine steps should automatically create a new step.
