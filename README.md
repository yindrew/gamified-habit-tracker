TODO

Refactor out the timer logic into its own submodule? or own folder?
app logic for streaking isn't working properly, or maybe it only works if the habit is over 3 days long? need to check
add logic for reseting at midnight so it updates properly
how does memory storage work? Closing out of the app loses the data such as flipping from all/today 
displaying timer as long notification. 
Fix the Habit Detail view for the different habits
the habits page shouldn't show completions, but show the actual metric instead. 
tracking screen time - habit for doing less than instead of greater than?

Testing application
Try and test the application for a week or so and verify its doing the right thing for logging data. 


(2) group work
Same completionist idea across multiple people? A group of people can log a single habit. Or maybe its more of just combining habits together ? If they both can work on the same habit, they can each have their own goals, and only when they complete it together does it count. 
how should the friends section look? 

The creation of a group habit. It takes the whole group to complete a day with each person creating their own part. I'm not sure how well this will work in practice, and people can easily just cheat and not do it. Accountability is good, but its hard to enforce real action.
