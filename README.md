to do 


decrease the cooldown on the button. 

clean up the completion page and make it look less corny and a little bit cooler. I want something circular completing. similar to a move ring filling up with all the habits completed today.

add different increments. maybe it can just be adding a note on the side for each one that 1 = the metric. For the first pass that seems reasonable. before the goal add a metric and a increment. The goal should than adjust to that and complete (increment) metric times per day

setup unit tests and figure out how to write unit tests in swift. Verify that days changing works, check out the metrics and see how they look and what are some important things to track.

Clean up and validate the coping plan. I like the idea of having a extra life to preserve the streak, just need to validate it works correctly. The button currently does nothing.

for habits that aren't daily, only increment on the days it is active. 

supportive notes ? 

remove the little side arrow next to the habit. clicking on the habit is intuitive enough 

clean up the top, the "My Habits" + doesn't look all that clean. look at some designs. 

figure out social aspect, buddy system, group habits? 

notification tracking as well. Clean up the schema originally. Building the habit shoud take a while. set yourself up for success. if task isn't done, you can setup a notification before that gives a quick nudge.
